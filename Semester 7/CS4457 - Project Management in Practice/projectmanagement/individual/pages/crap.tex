"A domain-specific language (DSL) is a small, usually
declarative, language that offers expressive power focused
on a particular problem domain. In many cases,
DSL programs are translated to calls to a common subroutine
library and the DSL can be viewed as a means to
hide the details of that library."

Arie van Deursen Paul Klint Joost Visser 
"A domain-specific language (DSL) is a programming
language or executable specification language
that offers, through appropriate notations and abstractions,
expressive power focused on, and usually
restricted to, a particular problem domain."

argue here that providing a filter as opposed to a compiler it allows the admin to take off from where the specification left off

enhance productivity, reliability, maintainability, portability
\newline 
"Domain-specific languages (DSLs) have the potential
to make software maintenance simpler: domain-experts
can directly use the DSL to make required routine modifications.
At the negative side, however, more substantial
changes may become more difficult: such changes
may involve altering the domain-specific language. This
will require compiler technology knowledge, which not
every commercial enterprise has easily available. The
paper describes and uses the experience of the RISLA
language for interest rate products to discuss the role of
DSLs in software maintenance, the opportunities introduced
by using them, and techniques for controlling the
risks involved."
\newline 
argue here that providing a GPL abstract with  transformation engine, expressing that fowler said 'what the bloddy hell that lecturer was on about back in college about compilers, parse tress and grammer'

Reports the results of an experiment in which a templatebased
approach and a DSL approach to software generation
were compared. Several subjects were monitored
while performing a number of development and maintenance
tasks using alternatively template technology and
DSL technology. Flexibility, productivity, reliability, and
usability were measured. The DSL approach scored better
on all counts.
\newline 
much like group policy providing registry updates, dsl will provide optimzation at the domain levels
\newline 
cost of maintaining the DSL. constructsa of the language should be module specific but follow general over flow and try to integrate resuability and common words.
\newline 
reason for this that as the domain changes as it invariably does in the linux env, so will have the DSL and will incur over head of modifying the DSL as a whole.  Common terms should implment the same behaviour however specific terminonaly to a specific problem should be component based

Categorizes, describes and compares existing approaches
to software reuse, among which DSLs (or
application generators). Compared to the other approaches
DSLs reduce the intellectual effort required to
obtain an executable system from its specification. Limited
availability and difficulty of building DSLs of optimal
specificity/generality are listed as disadvantages of
DSLs.

Design Methodology

Analysis (1) 
Identify the problem domain. (2) Gather all relevant
knowledge in this domain. (3) Cluster this knowledge
in a handful of semantic notions and operations on
them. (4) Design a DSL that concisely describes applications
in the domain.

Implementation (5) Construct a library that implements the
semantic notions. (6) Design and implement a compiler
that translates DSL programs to a sequence of library
calls.

Use (7) Write DSL programs for all desired applications and
compile them


DSL Implementation

Interpretation or compilation
Embedded languages / domain-specific libraries
Preprocessing or macro processing
Extensible compiler or interpreter

Apart from building a dedicated DSL compiler or interpreter,
or reusing the implementation of an underlying base
language, other implementation techniques may be used. For
instance, in aspect-oriented programming [46] a DSL is used
to describe an aspect of a system’s behavior that is orthogonal
to its main functionality. An aspect weaver is then used
to generate domain-specific code and merge it with the main
code.
