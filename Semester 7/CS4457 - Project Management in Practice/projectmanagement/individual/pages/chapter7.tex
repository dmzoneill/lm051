\chapter{Quality Plan}

	\section{Introduction}
	
		The project must comply with all of the requirements described in project requirements specification.  
		The projects conformity to software requirements specification will be checked throughout the lifecycle 
		as defined in the rational unified process. Upon the supervisors verification that all of the tests have 
		been satisfactorily completed / passed, the project is considered to be of satisfactory quality.  
		Meaning that the project complies with all requirements and is accepted by the supervisor.

	\section{Review process}
	
		The communications plan outlines the meeting times when software reviews are scheduled to take place.
		The software reviews are in place to detect any defects in the current fidelity prototypes during its construction.  
		The determination of new enhancements, or regressions should be documented and the risk register updated accordingly.
		This should be completed for each of the 4 individual components as outlines in the objectives.  
		\newline
		\newline
		The supervisor in conjunction with the student will attend each review, and critique software prototypes to 
		ensure that the maximum number of possible defects are accounted for, moreover identify risks in the current direction.
		\newline
		\newline
		This review process is subject to the work completed, accounting for disruptions in the work scheduled due to other academic commitments.
		The risk and schedule log should to addressed and adjusted accordingly based upon work interruptions.
		Each meeting will consist of no more than a one hours.  The current	prototype should be provided in advance of this meeting.  
		Any enhancement found to be too difficult or unnecessary for product completion will be noted by the student.
